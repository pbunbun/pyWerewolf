Werewolf IRC Game Bot
=====================

Description
-----------
pyWerewolf is a fully object orientated werewolf IRC game bot written in python using the irclib IRC framework.

Usage
-----------
python pyWerewolf.py <#channel> <nickname> <server> <port>

Default options are stored in config.py

TODO
-----------
Lots of stuff, specifically:  
* Tidy everything up a bit, and figure out what things do >.>  
* Option to have traitor revealed on death.  
* Options to have roles not revealed when wolf/vote kills.  
* Option for number of people required for certain roles, and/or their rarity.  
* Colour output support (and perhaps a cleanup/rewrite of the theme system).

More long term (read: Will almost certainly never happen):
* Support for logging (could eventually be used for game statistics).
